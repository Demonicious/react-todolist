# Todolist made in React.js for learning.

Obviously does not use "good react coding practices" as this is only my first "real" project. Yeah i know i use too many quotes in my sentences. Anyways.

I don't know why you'd wanna clone this but..

```
1.) Clone
2.) npm install in the root directory.
3.) npm start
```
